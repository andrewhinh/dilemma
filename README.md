# Dilemma

Buy and sell homes with ease.

## Problem

Buying and selling homes shouldn't require a real estate agent. At the end of the day, it's just a transaction between two parties.

## Solution

Dilemma: a platform that connects buyers and sellers directly.

## Contributing

If you'd like to develop in Docker, create a `.env` file:

```bash
# Sign up for DockerHub here: https://hub.docker.com/signup
DOCKERHUB_USERNAME=<your username here>
DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD=<your password here>
echo "DOCKERHUB_USERNAME=$DOCKERHUB_USERNAME" >> .env
echo "DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD=$DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD" >> .env
```
