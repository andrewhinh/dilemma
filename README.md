# Dilemma

Learn anything.

## Problem

You want to learn something new, but you don't know where to start or which resources to use. Online discourse only sometimes helps, but staying motivated is difficult, especially when you're learning alone.

## Solution

Dilemma: a platform to find the best resources to learn anything, and stay motivated by learning with others.

## Contributing

If you'd like to develop in Docker, create a `.env` file:

```bash
# Sign up for DockerHub here: https://hub.docker.com/signup
DOCKERHUB_USERNAME=<your username here>
DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD=<your password here>
echo "DOCKERHUB_USERNAME=$DOCKERHUB_USERNAME" >> .env
echo "DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD=$DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD" >> .env
```
